# Thoughts on GOAD

## Installation

### Part 1: Proxmox

 - The install instructions aren't very clear
 	- the firewall rules need to be expanded on
	- our provisioning machine is supposed to have internet access but we never gave our router an adaptor that has access to the internet
	- ah this is what the iptable magic is for
	- author is using a vps so they are redacting some info so they dont expose their public ip and it makes following a little bit difficult
	- we are doing alot of things that dont get explained until after

### Part 2: Packer
 - The first image has some organization we haven't gone over yet
 - tf is a pool and why does it not exist
 - you create pools in the datacenter tab, this wasnt covered
 - I ended up having to make the IaC user an admin, the perm error had something to do with the sdn
 - had to change the vm's file format from qcow2 to raw
 - windows being windows and taking forever
 - winrm finally worked
 - i had a numbering scheme but it didnt care, maybe i missed somthing in the script
 - the cloudbase-init-p2 script for the 2016 box failed twice, then when I edited the script to do some print debugging it magically worked

### Part 3: Terraform
 - lol the very first thing it has us do is make the IaC account an admin
 - terraform doesnt tell you when theres an error it just keeps trying, this was learned after waiting an hour when the expected time is 25 minutes
 - set TF_LOG to DEBUG
 - 'local' doesnt support 'images', this seems to be refering to cloudinit, but it worked for the templates?
 - made backups of the templates and changed cloudinit to lvm
 - this didnt do anything, tried hotfixing it, terraform crashed
 - might just enable images on local, this did it, its not elegant but idk where local is being set instead of local-lvm

### Part 4: Ansible
 - had to change the adapter in the inventory file to "Ethernet 2"
 - ansible is having powershell reach out to the internet but we never set a rule for this vlan to touch the internet, creating
 - mssql on server 3 isnt working, it installed but you cant reach it on localhost, uninstalling and reinstalling
 - reinstalling worked

### Part 5: VPN
 - basic openvpn setup
 - I made a jumpbox instead
