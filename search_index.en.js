I'm one of those weirdos who build linux distros for fun. Usually I do it to see if I can implement an idea I found on some other distro and other times its to build a bespoke distro for some embedded machine. Some of the idea's I've tried and to various degrees succeeded in: ripping GNU out of linux, changing the default file structure, and I'm currently working on implementing some of the ideas from nix and guix. As you can imagine these distros aren't very user friendly, you really have to know what you are doing to not rip your hair out in frustration while using them.\nBasic Ideas and Goals\nAs you can imagine I'm not the biggest fan of macOS' ui/ux. I find the ui restrictive and the ux stifling. (At least windows doesn't hide the file system from you.) However, it is hard to argue with how macOS handles program installation. Dragging a single archive to your \"Applications\" folder then having a daemon handle the rest is probably the easiest way of installing an app through a gui. Then to remove it you just remove the file from the \"Applications\" and theoretically you don't have to worry about any orphaned dependencies or random junk mostly proprietary apps like to spew all across your filesystem.\nOn linux we have similar systems that could implement this and they all do it in a slightly different way. With everything in the linux ecosystem this is because people value different pros/cons. For the purposes of this distro I think AppImages fit the bill nicely.\nAppImages are essentially a small loader binary with a rootfs attached that has everything that would be needed to run a particular app. This means that for the most part they don't require any special software to run, unlike say snaps or flatpacks. Now this might not be that big of a pro since we're going to be running a daemon anyways.\nFor a Proof-of-Concept I think the AppImageLauncher would suffice. It's a daemon that watches the \"Applications\" folder for any new AppImage and it then handles setting the AppImage to be executable, the creation of .desktop files for integration into start menu and app launchers and it handles any permissions issues you might run into.\nNow since most people use Windows for their operating system most people are used to going to various websites to install software. This creates a problem for us for a couple reasons: Websites that auto-detect a user is using linux will likely give them a .deb or .rpm even if there is an AppImage available, and a lot of software developers will only support a handful of distro-specific package formats (.deb and .rpm).\nOne of the ways we can get around this is by having an appstore. macOS users are already used to this for Apple-sanctioned software but I'm really not sure how many Windows and Linux users actually use their respective appstores. Since this distro is aiming for average people my assumption is that they would use the provided appstore instead of seeking out binaries on the web as long as the appstore is easy to use and access. The thought process behind this assumption is that theoretically they know it's not Windows so they think that they have to install software a special way and if we point out the appstore that tells them the \"special\" way to install software even though going to a website and downloading a regular package and just double clicking would still be possible based on my helpdesk experience I don't think the average person would think to do that. There are a couple different AppImage stores, I need to do more research to find the one I want to use for this project.\nThis is the main goal of this project. Use AppImages for any user-installed software and setup a store for ease of use.\nExtra Goals\nUnifying the GUI in terms of ui is always going to be top priority in terms of extra goals\nSetting up zfs on the root drive while automating and attaching applets to the gui so average users can actually take advantage of some of some of its features. (Mostly snapshots)\nSetting up a timemachine-like backup system would be nice\nPOC Implementation Ideas\nI'm not really interested in bootstrapping this distro as of now so I'll probably use some minimal distro to build off of. Probably Arch. If this does get past the proof-of-concept phase I'd like to either build off of some immutable distro or bootstrap my own. An immutable distro would allow for better version control over the filesystem which facilitates easier rollbacks in case something breaks and it prevents any accidental corruption from the user. (Reminder dd is also known as \"disk destroyer\" and rm -rf / is easier than deleting system32)\nI'm thinking about using plasma as the DE just for the poc. I might stick with it if it goes farther than poc but honestly its a bit overwhelming to try and maintain with config scripts. It's easy to config in the provided gui so it would be good from an end user perspective but setting the base config is a bit daunting.\nI remember there being quite a few mac-like app docks, I'll throw one of those in for the lolz.\nI am keeping gaming in mind so I need to test steam in an appimage and determine whether to use lutris or hero for non-steam games.\nThings to do if this project expands\nDo a bit more research into what specifically and why people like macOS' ui/ux since I never really groked it and possibly implement some of those features.\n","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/friendlyos/init/","title":"Intro"},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/","title":"Homelab"},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/archived/":{"body":"Out of date\nThis is not part of the project but an old article I half worked on. Proceed with caution.\nWhy build a lab?\nI recently got a position as a Security Analyst where I'm the unofficial Red Teamer. Having a lab environment allows me to demo attacks or wacky ideas I have. I've also wanted a lab environment for a while but never had any motivation to make one.\nInfrastructure\nAt Shell on the Border I went to a workshop on Advanced AD Pentesting techniques and the person giving the workshop recommended Game of Active Directory as a lab environment. I have a local Proxmox cluster already which is running my network and media servers. I also had a minipc laying around not doing anything so I gave it a tb ssd, 32gb of ram and threw Proxmox on it. GOAD is pretty good as a lab environment because it has 2 forests, 3 domains, 3 domain controllers, and 2 servers. (5 total VMs)\nBuilding GOAD out\nThe instructions for building GOAD on Proxmox aren't the greatest. They don't explain what they are doing until later so you run into some issues when you have to modify it for your environment. The firewall rules weren't explained. Packer and Terraform didn't work without some tweaks. It wanted to make a backup of the templates to 'local' instead of 'local-lvm' and I wasn't able to figure out where that was being set so I ended up allowing backups to be saved to 'local'. I had to change the adapter in the ansible inventory file. I think this was a windows issue not a GOAD issue but mssql randomly didn't work on one of the servers so I had to uninstall and reinstall it.\nReading this all back I just condensed like 15 hours worth of work and pain into a few sentences and that makes me feel bad. You can read my full notes here.\nWazuh\nMy coworker stood up a Wazuh instance. Wazuh is an opensource XDR/SIEM built on top of ELK (Elastic Search, Logstash, Kibana). One of the servers has Defender disabled so I threw a Wazuh agent on it so we can play with it in an environment where we know malicious things will happen.\nCaldera\nI created another VM in the GOAD environment as my Caldera server. Caldera is an opensourse BAS (breach and attack simulation) software. I'm comparing this to other BAS software and one that I'm particularly interesting in comparing it to is Pentera. Pentera is agentless while Caldera is agent based. To get Caldera to work similarly I installed an agent on the Caldera server and created custom ability for the initial access plugin to remote into a machine and install an agent.\nThe adversaries Caldera comes with are super basic and can't do much. The adversaries that come with the emu plugin don't really work. They require very specific parameters to be met to work. Such as a specific c2 ip, files in specific locations, specific users to exist.\nThis means Caldera requires quite a bit of elbow grease but once you get it setup it works really well. The ttps come from atomic red team so you can string a lot together to make a custom adversary.\n","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/archived/","title":"Old WIP Article"},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/federation/":{"body":"Part 2\nSetting up FreeIPA, a secret store, DNS.\nAs well as troubleshooting DNS.\nBecause its ALWAYS DNS\nEvaluation\nThere's a few different ways we can do user federation. We can go the comercial route with Active Directory, Entra, Red Hat Directory Services. We could go with FreeIPA, which is Red Hat Directory Services but unbranded or Samba since it can emulate a 2008 AD. We could also go simpler with something like OpenLDAP.\nI'm going to use FreeIPA since it handles everything I need:\n\nuser federation and authentication\nACLs\na CA\nintegration with SSSD\n\nNow I typically prefer Debian-based distros but FreeIPA only supports Redhat-based distros. So the Realm controller will have to be Redhat-based. Our other servers and clients can be Debian-based since the freeipa-client package has been ported to the Debian stable repo. If you want to use a distro that doesn't have a freeipa-client package you can either port it yourself or configure sssd and pam to manually join the realm.\nSetup\nI downloaded AlmaLinux 9.5 minimal. However I'm fairly certain after I installed FreeIPA I was running the base install since things like pipewire got installed. Created a VM and set it to autostart since its going to be running my DNS. After creating and updating it I set a reservation for it in DHCP and reboot the machine.\nThe ipa-server-install script is really particular about setup. The FreeIPA docs will tell you to edit /etc/hostname but that won't work. What you actually have to do is edit /etc/hosts and add a line similar to &lt;ip&gt;   &lt;fqdn&gt; &lt;dn&gt;. That last entry is super important because if you dont have it the FreeIPA server installer will install most of the way then stop when it tries to start the web server. This will require you reinstalling FreeIPA.\nSince my management laptop isn't enrolled in the realm yet I need to make an entry in my hosts file. This is because the webserver will enforce the use of DNS. After that I got an HSTS error which is new. The last time I installed FreeIPA I didn't run into this so I assume this is a new default. Since Firefox erroneously doesn't have a way to bypass HSTS errors I had to use ungoogled-chromium to get to the login page. (Other Chromium-based browsers also have a bypass.)\nI created myself an unprivileged user account in the web interface for later use.\nSecret Store\nI haven't really documented it but I've been reusing passwords. This is bad for obvious reasons and now that I have user federation setup I'm going to setup a password manager and go back through all the server's I've setup so far and reset their password's with something autogenerated.\nSo far I've made 9 accounts that need their password reset and stored in a manager:\n\n2 local root vm acounts\n2 local user vm account\n1 local unifi account\n1 realm directory manager\n1 admin realm account\n1 firewall root account\n1 local root hypervisor accounts\n\nThis isn't too many which is why we should do this now before we start making more servers and having this number balloon. Remember that every vm is an immediate 2 more accounts that need to be reset and stored. (root,user)\nI'm going to use Passbolt. It's opensource using the AGPL-3.0 license. Passbolt isn't a typical password manager and it isn't going to be the password manager I use for my personal accounts. Passbolt is similar to CyberArk but much less annoying and janky to use. If that doesn't mean anything to you, you can think of Passbolt being a secret share for non-user and shared accounts. You can put ACLs on specific creds or vaults, share them securely, and setup good audit logs.\nSetting Up The Server\nI'm creating a Debian VM. (Which means I now have 11 accounts I need to reset and store.) Before installing Passbolt I'm going to add it to the Realm by installing freeipa-client. Apparently my reverse lookup isn't getting set dynamically. I added a PTR record and will make a note of this for later.\nNow that it's joined I can setup Passbolt. After setting it up I spent the next hour or so converting all the previous passwords I've previously setup. I also enrolled the unifi controller into the realm and setup DNS records for the hypervisors and the firewall. I also setup DHCP to set the Realm Controller as the DNS server.\nNext Steps\nI have a working Realm now but I still have some things I need to do before I am going to start setting up servers.\n\nNetwork ACLs\nCreate a Golden Image\n\nEDIT: DNS\nI noticed overnight that my phone didn't have dns. It turns out that by default the dns subsystem for FreeIPA restricts recursive lookups to localhost and the subnet the server is running on. So my phone which was on the wifi vlan wasn't allowed to make those look ups. This can be modified in the /etc/named/ipa-options-ext.conf file. As far as I can tell there is no indication this is the case in the GUI nor is there a way to change this in the GUI.\n","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/federation/","title":"Setting up a Realm"},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/intro/":{"body":"An ambitious lab\nA lab with media servers, user federation, sso, enterprise security, and security sub-labs.\nDefining this Project\nAs of writing, this is not intended to be a walkthrough on how to setup your lab 1:1 to mine. This is just a project log and notes for myself and I hope others can benefit from my writings when setting up their lab. So I won't be going over every detail just the basic steps I'm taking, notes on why I'm taking those steps, ideas for how to improve, or alternative things I or you could try, and any issues I run into. These notes assume you have a working knowledge of the linux cli, basic networking, and basic security concepts.\nI do want feedback on my writing since it's a skill I'm trying to develop. However if you have feedback on the lab implementation I'd love to hear it. I'm also open to questions but I can't create your lab for you.\nNew Lab\nI moved apartments and decided to rebuild my lab from scratch. A limitation of this new ISP is my WAN connection is now asymmetric (1000/100) but unlike my last ISP they allow me to use my own hardware without circumventing their hardware. I haven't stress tested it yet but I'm curious to see how this affects my VPN.\nSome of the goals for this new lab are:\n\nUsable Media Servers\n\nVideos\nMusic\nEBooks\nGames\nNotes\nNAS (for everything else)\n\n\nEnterprise Infra\n\nUser federation\nSSO\nSecret Store for Infra\nSecret Store for Users\nMesh VPN\nVDI\n\n\nSecurity Infra\n\n802.1x\nVuln management\nSIEM/XDR\nProper Network Segmenting\n\n\nWireless\n\nHost Isolation\nEAP\n\n\nSec Lab\n\nRed Team\nMalware Analytics\n\n\n\nSome improvements over the old lab.\nThe old lab was patchwork that was getting hard to maintain. I started getting user federation working but moved before it was completed. The enterprise infra section I'm really excited about because setting up that infra first will make everything else much easier to maintain. I had a redteam lab up and running and used it extensively so I'll probably just replicate it in the new lab. My job is as a PurpleTeamer so I've been looking to setup a blue-ish team lab and as of writing I've decided to scope it down to just malware analytics. This allows me to analyze malware samples that I find in a controlled environment and automates some of the basic tasks.\nWireless has always been a weakpoint in my lab. I've wanted an EAP setup for a while and the last time I attempted it the only hardware I had that had that capability was a pi4 using RaspAP. The software works pretty well however I don't know if I can recommend it. In my setup it was really flaky and I had to reboot the ap many times a day. I don't know if it was a software or hardware issue. I ended up reverting back to a standard locked-down consumer combo-box I had laying around. I have better hardware now so it should be doable.\nGeneral Notes for Scoping\nSecurity setup\nThe user connection flow I envision for the network is as follows. Theoretically only my desktop is connected via ethernet, it's on it's own vlan that I'll treat as basically a management vlan. Most other devices will connect via wifi. When they connect they get scanned for any vulnerable services running on open ports. If the scanner finds something a captive portal will come up and tell them they have been isolated from the rest of the network and will not be let back on until they fix the vulnerability. They will have a connection to the internet so they can update if needed. Otherwise they will need to authenticate using a cert. If they can they are let onto the \"secure\" network. Otherwise they are isolated from the rest of the network with only a connection to the greater internet. The secure network will get scanned nightly and anything running a vulnerable service will get isolated.\nAll of my devices (workstations, servers, and appliances) will have an Elastic agent running and collecting logs. The ELK stack is opensource once again, being triple licensed with AGPL-3.0, SSPLv1, and the Elastic License 2.0. I will be using the Elastic Defend integration which unfortunately is not opensource being licensed under the Elastic License 2.0. From my testing Elastic Defend was able to catch more malicious activity than Wazuh even catching some of my custom malware. I would love to see Wazuh improve so I don't have to run more proprietary code than absolutely necessary. I will say Wazuh does have some really nice features that Elastic doesn't have such as endpoint config assessments. This is something that I'm still looking into for my network. Wazuh is heavy for just endpoint config assessments. I'm looking into OpenSCAP for endpoint conifg assessments. It uses STIGs which are pretty good on their own and the format is XML so it's not too difficult to write your own. It's funded by Red Hat and while not my favorite license it is opensource using LGPL-2.1.\nSub-labs\nRed Team\nThe RedTeam lab will pretty much just be GOAD. I can't overstate how good of a lab this is. If you're looking into a redteam lab it can be setup with just virutalbox and vagrant. It has a few different configurations:\n\nFull: (5 vms, 2 forests, 3 domains)\nLight: (3 vms, 1 forest, 2 domains)\nMini: (2 vms, 1 forest, 1 domain)\nSCCM: (4 vms, 1 forest, 1 domain, with microsoft configuration manager installed)\nNinja Hacker Academy: (5 vms and 2 domains, with no documentation and minimal vulns)\n\nI'll be setting it up in proxmox with either the full or SCCM config. The last time I setup GOAD it didn't have the SCCM config. That config is closer to most of the environments I've been in so I might use it instead of Full. I'll be adding a RedELK instance, MythicC2, and an attack box.\nMalware Analytics\nI do my malware analysis by hand so I'm not really sure what a good lab would look like. I found an article that actually prompted this idea. They use radare for inital analysis and then pipe the output into an ELK stack. I know of radare and it's been recommended to me by my peers but I've never used it. I use PANDA.re for reverse engineering tasks and while not it's main purpose it can be used for malware analysis. There are also projects such as CAPEv2, Cuckoo3, and DRAKVUF Sandbox that could be what I'm looking for but I'll need to do a deeper dive. I could also contruct something like a terraform+ansible+packer chain that would deploy a vm loaded with tools to do manual analysis.\nMedia Servers\nI have a pretty good collection of media that I share with friends and family so having SSO and user federation setup would be amazing. I'm still debating on using a reverse proxy vs. a vpn. Previously I required people to setup zerotier on their machine to get to my media servers. This became a little annoying having to setup the agent on all of their devices but it give me piece-of-mind not having those servers exposed to the internet. Something like Authentik could work here since not only does it do SSO it also has a dashboard full of the apps the user has access to.\nI also need a better way of taking notes. My current solution is writing text documents in whatever folder I'm working out of which is really good for quickly taking detailed notes but terrible for retrieval. I've been looking into wiki systems on-and-off and my coworker showed me Bookstack which seems like it fits all of my requirements.\n","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/intro/","title":"Intro"},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/skel/":{"body":"Part 1\nSetting up a the bare minimum for a network.\nEvaluation\nI have collected a few different hardware components over the years that gives me a pretty wide range for my lab.\nFor servers I have:\n\n3 ThinkCentres: two with an Intel i5-6500T, one with a Ryzen 5 PRO 2400GE both with 8gb of ram.\na Minisforum MS-A1 which has a Ryzen 7 8700G with 32gb of ram.\nPoweredge T330\n\nFor networking equipment I have:\n\nFujitsu Futro S920 thinclient running OPNsense\nDell Optiplex 7020 running OPNsense\nmicrotik 5 port managed gigabit switch\n2 generic 8 port unmanaged gigabit switchs\nUbiquity U6 Enterprise wAP\na shit-ton of ethernet cables. like an ungodly amount. its everywhere. send help.\n\nSkeletal Build\nI need a usable network before I do anything else for the sanity of myself, visitors, and everyone else that uses the network and puts up with my shenanigans. (Love you guys!) This means I'm temporarily sacrificing security for speed. Which is fine for the most part since I won't have any servers running just yet.\nI'm using the optiplex for my firewall/router. It's an upgrade from the fujitsu thinclient so I'll have more storage and compute to run things like Suricata.\nOPNsense\nI'll be using OPNsense as my firewall. There's not a particular reason I'm using it over any other opensource firewall it just does what I need and it's what I'm familiar with.\nAfter initial setup I created a few vlans:\n\nWIFI (10.2.0.0/24)\nServers (10.3.0.0/24)\nWorkstations (10.4.0.0/24)\n\nThese will be expanded later but they work for now.\nI setup an any/any rule for each vlan that allows them to connect to anything on the network. This is temporary and should be considered a vulnerability.\nThe next thing to do is setup vlan tagging on the managed switch. I'm not a networking person so this could be a me issue but I don't find Microtik's vlan tagging definitions intuitive. For a simple setup you setup the ingress ports to strip any tags and apply their own tag based on which port the traffic is coming from and then you setup a trunk port for egress. To allow more vlans to be created and used from the servers and wAP you have to setup what Microtik's calls hybrid ports. Apparently Cisco calls these something else since a networking guy I was talking to didn't know what I was talking about. To do this I originally setup the port to leave the tag as is and apply a tag if the traffic is untagged. This straight up didn't work. I ended up having to set the port to do nothing if the traffic tagged and it would apply the default tag to untagged traffic. These two options sound very similar but they're separate options in the switch management page.\nAfter I figured that out the traffic was flowing correctly. DHCP gave me an IP, DNS was working, and I could reach the internet.\nProxmox\nNow that I have a networking backbone I need to setup wireless for everyone who's not me on the network. (I try to get people to use ethernet and have been unsuccessful so far.) To do this I need a wireless controller for the U6e wAP. Putting the unify server in a vm is kinda annoying because it's using a really old version of mongo and libssl. In the future we'll need to setup mitigating controls on this box because of this. But first I need to setup my proxmox cluster.\nThis is straight forward to do. Boot the iso, run through the installer, set static IPs. Wait ... set static IPs? Yeah this is a pain point for me I would prefer to have DHCP running for the hypervisors and just set a reservation it makes management alot easier. It can be done post-install but for now I'm going to leave it. I have my DHCP scope for the server vlan starting at .10 so I set the hypervisors to be .2, .3, .4, and .5. The NAS will be .6. After that I have the main node, the minisforum, create a cluster and have the other nodes join the cluster. I then remove the enterprise repo from all the nodes and add the community repo and update all the nodes.\nUnifi Controller\nNow that I have hypervisors are setup I can actually get WIFI working. I created a Debian 12 vm, updated it, then installed neovim and sudo. I then added the unifi, mongo, and bullseye-security repos for unifi, mongodb-org-server, and libssl1.1 respectively.\nI then reboot the vm, navigated to localhost:8443, and ran through the setup process. I then reset the wAP to factory defaults and took waaaaay too long to realize the controller couldn't see the ap because they had two different broadcasts. You can ssh into the ap using ui/ui creds and run set-inform http://&lt;controller-ip&gt;:8080/inform to manually send the adoption request.\nI was then able to adopt the ap without issue. I then setup a basic wireless network.\nNext Steps\nNow that I have a network that works I can start working on actual lab things.\nThese are the next things I need to work on: (order not solidified)\n\nGetting a realm setup\nNetwork ACLs\n\nAppendix 1 (Current Network Diagram)\n\n","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/skel/","title":"Building the Skeleton"},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/scratchpad/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/scratchpad/","title":"Scratchpad"},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/scratchpad/ascii-strip/":{"body":"Strip everything except ascii from Text files\nA really quick way of doing this is to use strings.

This was my 4th Defcon and probably my favorite so far. We had a huge showing from my homestate, we setup a pop up soldering village in the hallway on Thursday (the first day of dc where nothing really happens), gave out a bunch of badges for cool things, met a ton of cool peeps, and so much more. We (hackers from my home state and me) are already planning on amping it up for next year with a hallway con, party, and badge.\nThe badge is actually what I want to talk about. I've been in #badgelife since my first DefCon (second really but I scored 1 badge my first year). Badges are a huge part of my DefCon experience. I come from a long line of artists so #badgelife is the perfect intersection for me. Some of my favorite moments from this year was giving away Shell on the Boarder badges. I had a bunch of badges literally strapped to my backpack with paracord this year (I scored an 801 badge!!!!) and I had quite a few people come up to me to talk about it. The one I distinctly remember was this person roughly my age (which is weird for me lol) came up to me in the hallway to ask about the badges on my bag. They were super interested in #badgelife and told me it was their first DefCon. I happened to have the last working and flashed badge on me at the time so I gave it to them and I have never seen someone's face light up and get excited that quickly. These are the moments I live for at DefCon.\nSo badges are essential to my DefCon experience. I'm not usually one who goes for SAOs, usually all they do is light up/blink and I usually go after badges that do something or have some kind of challenge/CTF attached. This year however I sought after DC Punk's RickRoll SAO. This SAO has an spi oled screen, super crunchy speaker, and an rp2040. Is this overkill for an SAO? Yes. Do I love it? Also Yes. While my crew hasn't solitified anything for our badge one of the idea's thats been floated around is a suped up SAO. This is mostly inspired by DC Punk's SAO and most people at DefCon only wear the official badge. We also want our badge to interact with each other in some way. The DC Punk's SAO is roughly the same size as a Dreamcast VMU so I've floated the idea of making something like the VMU our badge. The VMU is a really interesting take on a memory card and I think the formfactor/device was under utilized. Only a few games supported VMU minigames and when plugged into the controller for a second screen (much like the WiiU) few games did anything interesting with it. However, the VMUs could interact with each other without the need for a Dreamcast. Usually this was just transfering save games between devices but there have been some homebrew VMU games that used that interface to implement multiplayer.\nThe idea is that our SAO could be an arduboy-type device in a VMU-ish formfactor. Or if we use the new rp2350 we could emulate an actual handheld console, this years official DefCon badge used that chip and emulated a Gameboy Color. I floated this idea specifically as a tic80 emulator and got some positive reception from the group but it hasn't been solitified. I've been wanting to make a badge for DefCon for a few years now and even made a prototype for a DreamBerd badge this year and ran out of time. I think I'm going to continue down this VMU thread and if it's not my group's badge it'll be my badge.\n","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/defcon32/","title":"Notes On: Defcon32"},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/dlink-ipcam-reverse-engineering/":{"body":"Reverse Engineering\nA D-link Security Cam\nPreface\nI'm using the firmware for the dcs-7410.\nI chose this firmware because I was told by a friend there is a vulnerability that someone with little experience could find and exploit.\nThis is the first time I've attempted firmware reverse engineering.\nYou will see me do some weird things like not using cd, it's so the terminal looks better for pictures.\nStarting\nAfter I upzipped it I used binwalk\n\nFrom this you can see a cramfs filesystem. Cramfs is a compressed rom file, which makes sense because you aren't supposed to be able to write to your firmware and it has a pretty good compression ratio.\n\n![](reverse_engineer2.png)\nI could've extracted this with dd but binwalk has a flag -e that tries to extract the files in the firmware. I got a few warnings but they don't seem to have actually affected me. Now that I extracted the filesystem I need to mount it in the cramfs-root folder.\n\n### Getting a lay of the land\n\n![](reverse_engineer3.png)\nAfter I mounted the image I need to find the web server and it's config files. Now most web servers are pretty bloated but there are a few that are light enough to be used in embedded systems such as,\n\nlighttpd\nbusybox http server (httpd)\nTiny/Turbo/Throttling HTTP server (thttpd)\n\nNow I've personally seen more lighttpd in my hobby development boards and SOCs, however we can clearly see that busybox is on this system so we should probably look for httpd first.\nNormally you could just do a banner grab on the website to get the server but as I don't have the ip cam physically I would need to emulate the cam which I wont do that now but I will later.\n\n![](reverse_engineer4.png)\nI'm using find instead of ls -R because find will give you the directory the file is in and I'm using grep instead of find -name because find -name is very literal and grep will just match the string.\nNow the results are interesting because I found lighttpd instead of httpd even when busybox is used on the camera. This is great for me because I've used lighttpd a lot more than httpd or thttpd.\n\nThere is nothing interesting in lighttpd.conf but it does `include` lighttpd-inc.conf\n\nNow when I do a file on lighttpd-inc.conf it says that its a symlink connected to /tmp/lighttpd-inc.conf, I did a ls on it to make it easier to read. However when you ls in the /tmp/ folder there is nothing there.\nNow if we go back to the images we can see a swap file, however when I file it says its a filesystem now if I try to mount the image it throws an error. If I take a longer look I can see the filesystem is in big endian, the filesystem on my computer is little endian so that's the issue.\n\n![](reverse_engineer6.png)\nTypically at this point I'd build a python script that would reverse the endianess however, thankfully there is already a tool out there specifically for the cramfs filesystem.\n\nBut that /tmp/ is also empty\n\n### Reevaluating the situation\nSo clearly I've missed something. I'm going to go back to the original image and go through more of the lighttpd files.\n\nSo lets take a look at /etc/rc.d/init.d/lighttpd.sh\n\nSo here we can see what seem to be admin pages.\n\n\nHere we can see the directories that require a login.\nNow we have to remember these aren't file directories these are web directories.\nSo /cgi/ wouldnt be in the root filesystem directory it would be in the root webserver directory.\nNow the root websever directory is usually /www however on this machine its in /var/www\n\n\nSo if we cross reference this ls with the protected directories we can see the following directories:\n\n/image/\n/video/\n/audio/\n/dev/\n/cht/\n/eng/\n/cgi/\n/users/\n\nThis leaves the following directories unprotected:\n\n/b/\n/cgi-bin/\n/common/\n/error/\n/i/\n/m/\n/md/\n/xsl/\n\nNow the most interesting directory in the unprotected list is /cgi-bin/\n\n\nThere is a single file in here and thankfully its not compiled so I don't have to decompile a binary.\n\n\nAnd there it is...\nLet me break this down.\nSo if you look at the last line there is an eval which takes a string and puts it into a shell.\nInside that eval they echo the query string.\nThis query string is then piped into a sed command.\nsed -e 's/&amp;/ /g' will substitute ampersands with spaces.\nSo to put it all together whatever you put into the query string, as long as you use amps instead of spaces, will be run in a terminal.\n\ndemo\nSo first I need to emulate the ip cam. But I'm just going to emulate the shell environment because I was having issues emulating the entire image.\nNow I can't find what CPU, or SOC more likely, this camera runs on but I'm going to make an educated guess and say whatever it is its based on the ARM architecture. (I looked at the opcodes)\n\n\nCramfs is a read-only file system so I made a new directory and copied everything from cramfs-root to cramfs-write.\nThen I copied over a qemu arm user environment. I then ran chroot as the qemu arm user and ran busybox.\nNow what I can do is jump into the shell. Also as a side note this version of busybox was outdated when this camera came out.\n\n\nI am getting some funky behavior, probably because I'm not emulating the whole device.\n\n\nHere I navigated to the injectable file and did an ls /\n\n\nIt will return the output to the browser.\nSynopsis\nSo this was the first time I've reverse engineered firmware. I intentionally went with old firmware and D-link because I wanted something easy to start with and old firmware is bound to have vulnerabilities and D-link doesn't have a very good reputation when it comes to security.\nI was not expecting the command injection to be that easy. I have also never seen command injection like that outside of CTFs or other labs.\nSome things I had difficulty with had mostly to do with the emulation part, I was having issues with qemu so I decided that instead of emulating the whole device it would be easier and quicker to just chroot ash and run lighttpd from there since all I needed was to prove that the command injection would work.\n","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/dlink-ipcam-reverse-engineering/","title":"Reverse Engineering A D-link Security Cam"},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/jolt-2023/":{"body":"Jolt 2023\nWhat is Jolt?\nJolt is a CTF in Little Rock Arkansas. This year my team, the r00tLeggers, got third place.\nJolt is put on by Central Arkansas Hackers in conjunction with The Venture Center.\nI'm a big fan of Jolt because it's not a super uber serious competition you are encouraged to collaborate and seek help from other teams.\nOne example is I had a lot of people ask how I solved a challenge involving a corupted and encrypted zipfile.\nThe zipfile had a .nfo file and a spanned zipfile using the magic bytes 50 4B 07 08. All the magic bytes for the zipfiles except the spanned file were broken, from my notes they were 50 4B 02 03. To decrypt the file you had to find the zip compressed text (not a file) appended to the file. Most people who asked for help on this challenge knew the magic bytes were wrong but they didn't really know how to fix them and were looking for a tool that would automatically fix it. They were suprised to hear you could edit the hex. When a few teams did that they also changed the spanned zipfile's magic bytes since they are nonstandard but this broke the midi file so they had to go learn about spanned zip archives.\nA Few Things I Learned / Challenges I Want To Talk About\nI mostly worked on Wifi and Reverse Engineering challenges this year so that's what I'll mainly focus on.\nIf you crack a password and can't login with it double check it in your wordlist\nThere was a challenge where you had to crack a wifi network's hash. So we loaded up aircrack grabbed the hash and threw it into hashcat.\nHashcat was able to crack the password using our wordlist in less than a second so we threw it into the flag submission and it was rejected.\n2 Attempts Remain\nOfcourse we forgot to put it in the flag format so we do that.\n1 Attempt Remains\nNow we were freaking out, we had the password and it was in the flag format but it wasn't taking it. We look over what we have and notice theres a space preceeding the password.\nAt this point we were super cautious since this was a 500 flag. We opened our word list in vim, showed all whitespace characters and noticed theres a space prepended and appended to the password.\nAfter making sure our whitespace was in the flag it accepted the flag.\nAt the time we didn't realize this challenge was even meaner for other teams since most teams used aircrack to crack the password.\nAircrack will trim the spaces off both ends of the password so you wouldn't even be able to catch the space preceding the password like we did with hashcat.\nStrip control characters and unicode out of your wordlist\nIn a different Wifi challenge we had to crack a wpa3 network's password. The thing about wpa3 is that you can't just grab the hash and pass it to hashcat.\nWe used a tool called wacker. This tool is really only useful for ctfs for a variety of reasons.\nHaving wacker go through our wordlist would've taken about 100 hours, well over the amount of time alloted for the ctf.\nThe box we were given for wifi challenges had 4 interfaces so we chunked up our word list and ran it in parrallel.\nOur fourth chunk died about half way through because of a control character being in our wordlist for some reason.\nI stripped out all control characters from that chunk that died by cating the chunk into tr -d \"[:cntrl:]\" and using a shell redirect to overwrite that chunk.\nI then used tac to reverse the line order so it would start from the bottom just so it wouldn't run through a bunch of passwords it's already tried.\nNow this chunk was instantly dying when loaded in wacker. So I opened it in vim and noticed there were quite a few unicode characters that wacker was choking on.\nI striped out unicode with iconv -c -f utf-8 -t ascii xad. (\"xad\" being the fourth chunk)\nAfter this we instantly got the password.\nWho need's a buffer overflow anyway?\nIn my favorite example of how much better I'm getting at reverse engineering we were given an elf binary. When you execute the binary it asks for a key.\nWhen you give it a string it thanks you then exits.\nI ran strings on it and found the flag format but not the flag itself. It seemed like the flag was being obfuscated.\nI opened it up in ghidra and decompiled it since my assembly isn't the greatest and found there was an if statement that was testing if a var isn't equal to 0.\nThis var was set to 0 when it was initialized and never touched so that statement would always return false.\nSo I patched the assembly to make that if statement always return true. Then when I had ghidra reassembly the binary I executed it asked it nicely to give me the flag.\nAfter talking with some other teams who solved it apearently the way it was meant to be solved was a buffer overflow attack, which in hindsight makes complete sense since the challenge was called \"buffed_up\".\nThe Challenge No One Solved\nI wan't to talk about this challenge a bit because it was pretty interesting. It was another elf binary and when executed it would call out to nullsrc.net/A1A1A-B2B2B and tell you it was checking server health. It would then ask you for a product key and whatever you put in it would make an HTTP Get request to that server with your input. In both instances it would return json with the expected hash, the hash it got, and whether or not that hash was activated.\nWhen I saw this my first thought was to poison the data. It was making all of these calls over http not https. So I wrote a quick webserver using netcat and made nullsrc.net point to localhost in my hosts file. This server would send back what I would always get for the server health call then after no matter what I sent the server it would return the expected hash, it would say the hash it recieved was the same, and the hash was activated.\nThis kinda worked. The binary was super happy, I got new output that suggested I had input the correct key but I didn't see a flag anywhere. I asked the game maker for that challenge and he said he figured someone would do something like this and put the flag server side.\nSome notes on the hash: it was md5 4 times, so the hash for password wouldn't be 286755fad04869ca523320acce0dc6a4 it would be 54fae49d0a9215910fff5b67c804461c.\nNo one was able to find a collision with or crack the expected hash.\nCompilation? Nah Fam We Live Interpretively!\nAnother elf binary. This time it would take your input do some math on it and give you the output. You had to figure out the input needed for the math to give you a flag.\nWhen decompiling it in ghidra I got some seemingly pretty simple math:\n\nSo I turned this into python code and added an iterator to bruteforce it. I then just piped the output and greped for the flag:\n\nThe flag bytes were found by tracing flag[local_1c] in ghidra.\nWhat Now?\nCompeting in Jolt has got me in a certain mood. I'm still working on one of the binaries that only 1 team solved. I know what I need to do but doing it has been difficult.\nIt has also gotten me way more motivated to complete my talk for Shell on the Boarder this year.\n","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/jolt-2023/","title":"Notes On: Jolt 2023"},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/png-stego-cah/":{"body":"These are some techniques I showed off at a local hacker meetup\nYou can find the slides here\nThe PNG File Format Annotated\n\nChunk Stuffing\nChunks explained\nThe PNG format is broken into what it calls \"chunks\". There are three or four chunks that are required for the file to be a valid PNG format. These are called \"critical chunks\". The three in the annotated hex above are:\n\nIHDR: Image Header, this must be the first chunk\nIDAT: Image Data, This is where the pixels are stored\nIEND: File Trailer, Tells the parser this is the end of the file, data field must be null\n\nEarlier I said their are 3 or 4 critical chunks. The fourth critical chunk is contingent on the color byte in the header being 0x03, which is a palette index color type. This chunk would be the palette index itself.\nThere are also ancillary chunks that give metadata to tell parsers more specifically how to parse a particular image. There are a ton of ancillary chunks built into the spec. A few we could inject data into are:\n\n\ngAMA: Gama chunk, This chunk is supposed to get ignored if there is an sRGB or iCCP chunk. The chunk is supposed to be a 4 byte unsigned integer but since it gets ignored we should be able to inject how much every data we want.\n\n\ncHRM: Chromaticity chunk, Also ignored if there is an sRGB or iCCP chunk so we should be able to inject whatever we want in this chunk.\n\n\ntEXt: Text chunk, this chunk has a specific format that has to be followed for it to be a valid chunk. Invalid ancillary chunks are supposed to be ignored but some parsers will throw an error at the user so we should follow it to prevent this.\n\nKeyword:        1-79 bytes (character string)\nNull separator: 1 byte\nText:           n bytes (character string)\n\nThere are predefined keywords that we can use. The biggest problem with using these keywords is windows' explorer.exe because it'll be shown in the properties tab.\n\nTitle: Short (one line) title or caption for image\nAuthor: Name of image's creator\nDescription:  Description of image (possibly long)\nCopyright: Copyright notice\nCreation Time: Time of original image creation\nSoftware: Software used to create the image\nDisclaimer: Legal disclaimer\nWarning: Warning of nature of content\nSource: Device used to create the image\nComment: Miscellaneous comment; conversion from GIF comment\n\n\n\nzTXt: tEXt chunk but compressed\n\n\niTXt: tEXt chunk but utf8 encoded\n\n\nCustom Chunks\nThe PNG format allows us to create our own chunks. The spec calls them \"private chunks\". There is a specific format we need to follow with the naming. The letters themself don't matter but the casing does.\n\n\n\nMost of the chunk options I've already talked about. The fourth one is a bit weird since it's for image editors. \"Safe to Copy\" means that if you edit the image the chunk will get transferred over to the new image. It is telling the editor the data in the chunk isn't dependent on the pixel data.\nThe chunk I used as an example was stEg.\n\ns: Lowercase -&gt; Ancillary chunk\nt: Lowercase -&gt; Private chunk\nE: Uppercase -&gt; Required\ng: Lowercase -&gt; Safe to Copy\n\nDemo Code\nYou can find my demo code here.\nLSB\n\nIn the annotated hex above its using color type 0x02 so every pixel is 3 bytes, one for r, g, and b. This means we can have 3 bits per pixel. So if our image is 500x500 we have 250,000 pixels to work with or 750,000 bits (93750 bytes, ~93 kilobytes). So with this method our paylod must be considerably smaller than our png. The colors also won't perceptibly change.\n","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/png-stego-cah/","title":"PNG Stego"},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/rsa-crypto/":{"body":"This page is based on an email I had with a teacher\nI had missed a question on a test where the test was incorrect and I wrote the email to get the point back. Surprisingly it worked.\nI've shared the email enough that I figured it would be better to just make a post about it.\nThe Basics\nRSA is conceptually simple. There are two keys, a public and a private key. The public key can be given out freely but the private key should be protected and never given out to anyone.\nSay Alice wants to talk to Bob but they are communicating over a monitored line, meaning anything they send will be received by a third party. If they don't want to have that third party knowing what they are saying they can send each other their public key over that monitored line.\nAfter they send their public keys over that line they can then encrypt their messages using the other's public key. So for example if Alice wants to send a message to Bob she would encrypt the message using Bob's public key and send it over the monitored line. Bob would then decrypt the message using his private key.\nThe third party would only be able to see that encrypted message and assuming Alice and Bob are using good encryption with a large enough key length the third party wouldn't be able to decrypt the message with only the public key.\nRSA Algorithm\nThere are three parts of the algorithm: key generation, encryption, and decryption.\nThe easy part is encryption and decryption so we'll start with that.\nThe encryption algorithm is:\n\n\nc is the resulting ciphertext\n≡ basically means its equal (this is a simplification but it's ok for now)\nm is the padded plaintext message (padding is just adding some extra bits for a couple different reasons, padding could be its own page so I won't get too deep into it)\ne is the public key exponent of the person you're sending the message to\nn is the product of that person's two prime factors, this is sent with the public key\n\nSo to put it together the ciphertext is calculated using the message to the power of the public key of the person you're sending it to then modulo that by the product of that person's two prime numbers.\nThe decryption algorithm is:\n\nThis looks complicated but it's basically just ciphertext to the power of the private key exponent. The rest of that algorithm is just showing work.\nNow for the comparatively complicated part: Key Generation.\n\nThe first thing that needs to be generated are two large prime numbers, these are known as p and q.\nFrom there you generate n which is n = pq. This is your key length.\nYou need to compute lambda(n) where \"lambda\" is Carmichael's totient function. This is expressed as lambda(n) = lcm(p - 1, q - 1)\nThen we need to choose an integer e where 2 &lt; e &lt; lambda(n) AND gcd(e, lambda(n)) = 1. Essentially we need to make sure \"e\" and \"lambda(n)\" are coprime. This is your public key exponent.\nFinally we need to calculate d where d ≡ e⁻¹(mod lambda(n)) or for the math nerds, \"d\" needs to be the modular multiplicative inverse of \"e modulo lambda(n)\" This is your private key exponent.\n\nPutting it into practice\nOpenSSL Baseline\nMan that's a lot of math talk, if you're anything like me you need examples. Before we get into the nitty-gritty with python lets get a baseline with the standard Openssl tool.\nFirst lets generate the private key with a key length of 2048: openssl genrsa 2048. This will output the key to stdout to put this in a file you can either use shell redirects or the -out flag.\nHere is the key I generated. (Please note this key was generated for the purposes of explanation. I don't use this key and you shouldn't either.)\n\nTo find what numbers were used in this keys generation you can run openssl rsa -in private.pem -text -noout. This will give all the numbers used to generate both private and public keys in hex.\nTo convert this to decimal we can do some bashfu. The modulus is the easy part because there is a -modulus flag we can use to output the modulus in hex without anything else or any colons: openssl rsa -in private.pem -modulus -noout | sed -e 's/Modulus=/ibase=16; /' | bc\n\nOriginal Modulus output: Modulus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nBashfu oneliner output: 25468106082921794971929409506903775758728045423753973170996959875345803013722474541045565883815682177434955104383906639041388567454940137687663026589323306165475698385730572512046618474721376990576162384898600637901272248576695044354175677353663993053604053214742119796047637103645642070127143302862228807476663080956490039342214965817463705457380197342311783922066124952133161913392372304617410084643208670689823597752814889511157649686062558985502814811733665601943693667553357863982055267040184966104535775272478573916097964350996183228704435845314131797767367898143161396024687771146955440326737475094160322644431\n\ne is already in decimal. To get it we can run: openssl rsa -in private.pem -text -noout | grep publicExponent | cut -d' ' -f2\n\nThe output of which would be:\n65537\n\nThis is actually the most common value for e, some implementations even hardcode this value for e.\nIt's much more complicated to get the rest of the numbers into decimal. You have to use this arcane tomfoolery.\nopenssl rsa -in private.pem -text -noout | awk '/prime1/{f=1;next} /prime2/{f=0} f' | sed -z 's/\\n//g' | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' | sed -e 's/    /ibase=16; /' | sed -e 's/    //g' | sed -e 's/://g' | echo $(&lt;/dev/stdin) | bc\nIf I knew more awk this oneliner would probably be shorter. Honestly if your oneliner is this long you should look into making a script.\nHere is what this oneliner is doing:\n\nopenssl rsa -in private.pem -text -noout This prints out all the numbers we need in a way that needs a lot of post processing.\nawk '/prime1/{f=1;next} /prime2/{f=0} f' cuts out and prints only what is inbetween the strings \"exponent1\" and \"exponent2\", this is our hex that we have to process a bit more.\nsed -z 's/\\n//g' This removes all the break lines.\ntr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' This converts all the lowercase characters to uppercase, this is important because bc requires hex to be uppercase.\nsed -e 's/    /ibase=16; /' This replaces the first soft-tab (four spaces) with the string \"ibase=16; \" (that space is important). This is to tell bc what the incoming number's base is.\nsed -e 's/    //g' This removes the rest of the soft-tabs.\nsed -e 's/://g' This removes all of the colons.\necho $(&lt;/dev/stdin) This takes everything its given and echos it back. The reason for this is because bc requires the file its given to be breakline terminated and when we removed all the breaklines we made it NULL byte terminated and echo will automatically breakline terminate what it's given.\nbc This is a calculator it takes the string we gave it and since we told it the input is base16 and didn't tell it to do anything else it will just output it in it's default base which just happens to be base10.\n\nHere is the output, this would be p in the algorithm:\n155914412676434675314820481330982951827486100759784364030252893898688913090630372157763542261719781624233993313959510526992259203526385534804748738559933412515374992441436966925006082075153066647463756075095883082749743200243171265715537247653604857193825438674261300552713707139224336927994866325867294412357\nTo get q we simply change the awk command to be awk '/prime2/{f=1;next} /exponent1/{f=0} f'.\n\nThe output of which would be:\n163346708272410490172882278503333820513575790750437110978123060377446751068976433661783430090185519420190349809551840135224191547707060554245081804237066395852443481289521744551767634302275175142839715462228814818980848446348299322499179342179183207006986673200678816332938667830000104560034958148053831668483\nTo get d we change the awk command to be awk '/privateExponent/{f=1;next} /prime1/{f=0} f'.\n\nThe output of which would be:\n1405395511678695569159142308645765064489372053572886216532805978137358997194368512102953888930213689895685111234942068756476215789566062040487561769081400380661959857973276400961542269463507024832059619222512309183666495063515535161921911853602176341278347474725954441649850917578382662413824461827688946430843606274855955090103821457312917652310054371695742108881766776794023764138582730768916367023231131060661708719759467907398810533710873045608163596267901366288770505797621290798104135495549989982489603223494880641560639079992670449735738127888799908638531653890764335505230961293265852225463268359370966848837\nPython\nSince RSA requires you to bring your own p and q I'm just going to use the values generated from OpenSSL.\n\nMy output is:\n\nFun Stuff\nThis section is mainly what the email was about\nIf you remember back to the beginning of this writeup I stated that as long as Alice and Bob used a long enough key their messages couldn't be decoded with only the public key. But what if they weren't using a long enough key? How would you generate a private key from a public key?\nTo start I generated a new 64bit key using a patched version of OpenSSL to remove the minimum key length requirements.\n\nIt's values are:\n\nn: 11748712157569019959\ne: 65537\n\nThe public key gives us n and e. That leaves p, q, and d for us to solve.\nTo get p we need to factorize n since both p and q are prime. Then to get q all we need to do is divide n by p.\n\nThis gives me: p = 3221634953 and took about 2 minutes.\nPlugging these numbers into the key generation script from earlier:\n\nAnd we get: d = 699863775216061441\nand the full key:\n\nNow to test to make sure this key works. Say Alice sends \"Hi World\" (NULL terminated) using the weak public key. openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -inkey weak_key.pub -pubin -pkeyopt rsa_padding_mode:none -in plain.txt -out cipher.txt\nSince Bob sent his public key over the line we are monitoring we have a copy of that key and we just generated a private key from it. Testing to see if it works: openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey cracked_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_padding_mode:none -in cipher.txt -out clear.txt\nWe now have a file called \"clear.txt\" that shows \"Hi World\" (Null terminated of course).\n","id":"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/rsa-crypto/","title":"RSA Explained"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/":{"body":0,"title":4},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/contrarianos/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/contrarianos/init/":{"body":123,"title":1},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/d4s3/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/d4s3/v5/":{"body":104,"title":1},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/d4s3/v6/":{"body":117,"title":1},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/friendlyos/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/friendlyos/init/":{"body":582,"title":1},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/archived/":{"body":302,"title":3},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/federation/":{"body":498,"title":3},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/intro/":{"body":713,"title":1},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/projects/homelab/skel/":{"body":488,"title":2},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/scratchpad/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/scratchpad/ascii-strip/":{"body":32,"title":0},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/scratchpad/nc-web/":{"body":28,"title":0},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/scratchpad/python-oneliners/":{"body":18,"title":0},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/scratchpad/wget-spider/":{"body":89,"title":0},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/defcon32/":{"body":330,"title":2},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/dlink-ipcam-reverse-engineering/":{"body":552,"title":6},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/jolt-2023/":{"body":649,"title":3},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/png-stego-cah/":{"body":354,"title":2},"https://blog.d4s3.xyz/write_ups/rsa-crypto/":{"body":795,"title":2}},"length":25},"lang":"English"}
