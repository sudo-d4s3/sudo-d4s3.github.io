        <h1>Reverse Engineering</h1>

<h2>A D-link Security Cam</h2>

<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>I&#39;m using the firmware for the <a href="https://eu.dlink.com/uk/en/products/dcs-7410-securicam-day-and-night-outdoor-network-camera">dcs-7410</a>.</p>

<p>I chose this firmware because I was told by a friend there is a vulnerability that someone with little experiance could find and exploit.</p>

<p>This is the first time I&#39;ve attempted firmware reverse engineering.</p>

<p>You will see me do some weird things like not using <code>cd</code>, it&#39;s so the terminal looks better for pictures.</p>

<h3>Starting</h3>

<p>After I upzipped it I used <code>binwalk</code></p>

<p><img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>From this you can see a cramfs filesystem. Cramfs is a compressed rom file, which makes sense because you aren&#39;t supposed to be able to write to your firmware and it has a pretty good compression ratio.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I could&#39;ve extracted this with <code>dd</code> but <code>binwalk</code> has a flag <code>-e</code> that tries to extract the files in the firmware. I got a few warnings but they don&#39;t seem to have actually affected me. Now that I extracted the filesystem I need to mount it in the cramfs-root folder.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Getting a lay of the land</h3>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>After I mounted the image I need to find the web server and it&#39;s config files. Now most web servers are pretty bloated but there are a few that are light enough to be used in embedded systems such as,</p>

<ul>
<li>lighttpd</li>
<li>busybox http server (httpd)</li>
<li>Tiny/Turbo/Throttling HTTP server (thttpd)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I&#39;ve personally seen more lighttpd in my hobby development boards and SOCs, however we can clearly see that busybox is on this system so we should probably look for httpd first.</p>

<p>Normally you could just do a banner grab on the website to get the server but as I dont have the ip cam physically I would need to emulate the cam which I wont do that now but I will later.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I&#39;m using <code>find</code> instead of <code>ls -R</code> because <code>find</code> will give you the directory the file is in and I&#39;m using <code>grep</code> instead of <code>find -name</code> because <code>find -name</code> is very literal and <code>grep</code> will just match the string.</p>

<p>Now the results are interesting because I found lighttpd instead of httpd even when busybox is used on the camera. this is great for me because I&#39;ve used lighttpd alot more than httpd or thttpd.  </p>

<p><br>
There is nothing interesting in lighttpd.conf but it does <code>include</code> lighttpd-inc.conf</p>

<p><img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer5.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now when I do a <code>file</code> on lighttpd-inc.conf it says that its a symlink connected to /tmp/lighttpd-inc.conf, I did a <code>ls</code> on it to make it easier to read. however when you <code>ls</code> in the /tmp/ folder there is nothing there.</p>

<p>Now if we go back to the images we can see a swap file, however when I <code>file</code> it says its a filesystem now if I try to mount the image it throws an error. If I take a longer look I can see the filesystem is in big endian, the filesystem on my computer is little endian so thats the issue.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer6.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Typically at this point I&#39;d build a python script that would reverse the endianess however, <s>thankfully</s> there is already a tool out there specifically for the cramfs filesystem.</p>

<p><br>
But that /tmp/ is also empty</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Reevaluating the situation</h3>

<p>So clearly I&#39;ve missed something. I&#39;m going to go back to the original image and go through more of the lighttpd files.</p>

<p><img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So lets take a look at /etc/rc.d/init.d/lighttpd.sh</p>

<p><img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer7.1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So here we can see what seem to be admin pages.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer7.2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here we can see the directories that require a login.
Now we have to remember these aren&#39;t file directories these are web directories.</p>

<p>So /cgi/ wouldnt be in the root filesystem directory it would be in the root webserver directory.
Now the root websever directory is usually /www however on this machine its in /var/www</p>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer8.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So if we cross reference this <code>ls</code> with the protected directories we can see the following directories:</p>

<ul>
<li>/image/</li>
<li>/video/</li>
<li>/audio/</li>
<li>/dev/</li>
<li>/cht/</li>
<li>/eng/</li>
<li>/cgi/</li>
<li>/users/</li>
</ul>

<p>This leaves the following directories unprotected:</p>

<ul>
<li>/b/</li>
<li>/cgi-bin/</li>
<li>/common/</li>
<li>/error/</li>
<li>/i/</li>
<li>/m/</li>
<li>/md/</li>
<li>/xsl/</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the most interesting directory in the unprotected list is /cgi-bin/</p>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer9.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There is a single file in here and thankfully its not compiled so I don&#39;t have to decompile a binary.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer10.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And there it is...</p>

<p>Let me break this down.</p>

<p>So if you look at the last line there is an <code>eval</code> which takes a string and puts it into a shell.
Inside that <code>eval</code> they <code>echo</code> the query string.
This query string is then piped into a <code>sed</code> command.
<code>sed -e &#39;s/&amp;/ /g&#39;</code> will substitute ampersands with spaces.</p>

<p>So to put it all together whatever you put into the query string, as long as you use amps instead of spaces, will be run in a terminal.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>demo</h3>

<p>So first I need to emulate the ip cam. But I&#39;m just going to emulate the shell environment because I was having issues emulating the entire image.</p>

<p>Now I can&#39;t find what CPU, or SOC more likely, this camera runs on but I&#39;m going to make an educated guess and say whatever it is its based on the ARM architecture. (I looked at the opcodes)</p>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer11.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Cramfs is a read-only file system so I made a new directory and copied everything from cramfs-root to cramfs-write.</p>

<p>Then I copied over a qemu arm user environment. I then ran <code>chroot</code> as the qemu arm user and ran <code>busybox</code>.</p>

<p>Now what I can do is jump into the shell. Also as a side note this version of busybox was outdated when this camera came out.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer12.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I am getting some funky behavior, probably because I&#39;m not emulating the whole device.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer13.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here I navigated to the injectable file and did an <code>ls /</code></p>

<p><br>
<img src="../static/pics/dlink_ipcam_reverse_engineering/reverse_engineer14.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It will return the output to the browser.</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>

<p>So this was the first time I&#39;ve reverse engineered firmware. I intentionally went with old firmware and D-link because I wanted something easy to start with and old firmware is bound to have vulnerabilities and D-link doesnt have a very good reputation when it comes to security.</p>

<p>I was not expecting the command injection to be that easy. I have also never seen command injection like that outside of CTFs or other labs.</p>

<p>Some things I had difficulty with had mostly to do with the emulation part, I was having issues with qemu so I decided that instead of emulating the whole device it would be easier and quicker to just <code>chroot</code> ash and run lighttpd from there since all I needed was to prove that the command injection would work.</p>
