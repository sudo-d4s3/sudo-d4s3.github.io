        <h1>Playstation Horror Box</h1>

<h2>Neo-Retro Horror Games Styled Like Original Playstation Games</h2>

<h3>Playstation Horror Box?</h3>

<p>I am a big fan of Halloween and Autumn in general. (Mostly because I like wearing my hacker hoodie and Autumn is the best season for that.)
Almost every year a bunch of indie horror developers get together and submit demos for their upcoming games to the <a href="https://hauntedps1.itch.io/">PS1 Demo Disc or Madvent Calendar</a>.
I&#39;m a huge fan of these demos and retro indie horror as a genre. I&#39;ve played a few of these demos during a friend&#39;s Holloween party but this was just a laptop with a wireless keyboard/mouse hooked up to their tv. It&#39;s functional but for Holloween I feel like I need to go all out and give it PS1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Drowned">Ben Drowned</a> vibes. I need the device to <em>feel</em> haunted; like I picked it up from sketchy mage-dude.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to find a broken Playstation 1, slap some x86 board in it, plug in some original (analog) ps1 controllers, and load up the PS1 Demo Discs.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Broken Playstation 1</li>
<li>Analog Playstation 1 Controllers (unfortunitely most of these games wont be playable with the actual original ps1 controllers)</li>
<li>Cheap x86 sbc with enough power to play these games smoothly</li>
<li>Playstation 1 to USB adaptors</li>
<li>Bondo (probably idk how extensive the case modding will get)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>Unfortunitely I&#39;m going to have to use Steam&#39;s Big Picture Mode since some of these games don&#39;t natively support controllers and Steam makes this super easy.</p>

<p>This is a double-sided sword. It creates some complications. The initial idea was to create an account on the machine that didn&#39;t require a password and boot up straight to some splashscreen showing the games. (Like a console.) 
But if I do this my steam account is at risk and more importantly my other &quot;normal&quot; games will show up unless I hide them. As far as I know hiding games isn&#39;t device specific so this would affect my main gaming pc aswell. I could make an account specifically for this machine. Steam doesn&#39;t require anything other than an email to spin up an account and 15$ worth of purchases to unlock everything a standard account gets. (not that this really matters for this use case).</p>

<p>However on the otherhand, this gives us easy access to proton, big picture mode, and whatever you call how smoothly they handle controllers and shim them for non-controller games. It&#39;s also very easy to add non-steam games into your library so they can take advantage of all of these features. Using Steam also allows me to easily integrate horror/ARG youtube videos or horror films.</p>

<p>There is a small community around creating skins for Steam which might be something I want to look into since I think the current look is a bit too new for my horrorbox.</p>

<h3>Start of Project</h3>

<p>When I initially started looking for Broken PS1s eBay only found 1 ps1 and it was working. I don&#39;t really want to buy a working ps1 just to gut it. Sony isn&#39;t making ps1s anymore so there&#39;s what we currently have is what we have and I imagine there is someone out there who wants an original ps1. (As someone with an original N64 I get it.)</p>

<p>The next day eBay gave me a huge amount of Broken PS1s so I&#39;m not quite sure what happened there. I bought a beige &quot;for parts&quot; ps1 that looked like it was in good cosmetic condition.</p>

<p>I also found a site that has the dimensions of the original Playstation: <a href="https://www.dimensions.com/element/playstation">https://www.dimensions.com/element/playstation</a>. This will be useful for finding a suitable sbc.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find any working analog ps1 or dualshock 1 (the difference is the dualshock has motors) controllers. So I picked up two dualshock 2 controllers. They are visually similar enough to where you have to know what to look for when distinguishing between the dualshock 1 and 2 controllers. I learned that the connector the ps1 and 2 controllers use is the same so I picked up 2 ps1-2 to usb converters. These will be retrofitted into the controller ports so plugging in the controllers will be seamless.</p>

<p>I decided on a bearbones skull canyon nuc for the sbc. The chasis dimentions fit in the ps1: <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/89187/intel-nuc-kit-nuc6i7kyk/specifications.html">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/89187/intel-nuc-kit-nuc6i7kyk/specifications.html</a>. The igpu is an &quot;Intel Iris Pro Graphics 580&quot;. It&#39;s not the greatest and I have some concerns about it&#39;s power that made me look into a hades canyon nuc. Hades Canon NUCs have a much more powerful &quot;AMD Radeon RX Vega M GH&quot;. It&#39;s also a bit bigger but should still fit into the ps1: <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/nuc8i7hvkva-product-brief.pdf">https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/product-briefs/nuc8i7hvkva-product-brief.pdf</a>. The biggest issue is that the price is double that of a skull canyon nuc and I can&#39;t currently justify that price.</p>

<p>I also bought a super cheap 256gb samsung evo 970 nvme drive for the nuc. I might regret not going for a 512gb or 1024gb drive since that dramatically reduces the amount of movies, youtube videos, and games I can store on the machine. I haven&#39;t checked the total size of all of those games but I&#39;m hoping they&#39;ll all fit without issues. I&#39;m planning on using linux so the os taking up a bunch of space won&#39;t be an issue. I can also always drop tailscale on it and have it talk to my jellyfin server. Or try to re-encode all the videos to be as small as possible without loosing <em>too</em> much quality.</p>

<p>I also bought a single 8gb stick of ram for the nuc. I don&#39;t expect to need more than that but if I do I have some sodimm ram laying around I can use. (Assuming there&#39;s a second sodimm slot.)</p>
