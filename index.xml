      <description>Init I first learned about cyberdecks through Shadowrun Returns and thought the concept was pretty cool and found this post which has been moved. That post sent me to r/cyberdecks and the first deck I saw was D10D3&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Cyberdeck v3&amp;rdquo; which made me want to make one myself.
Now what exactly is a cyberdeck? Well Gibson says &amp;ldquo;eh fuck it&amp;rdquo;. (not actually but he did say &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; my sense of that a &amp;ldquo;deck&amp;rdquo; looked like was extremely low-resolution.</description>

      <description>Under Construction I am currently migrating my personal site over here so I can stop getting slashdotted everytime I post about a project and uptime will be closer to 100%. This will be a slow process as I have school and other projects I am working on. Things like the theme and layout are subject to change but I will be committed to keeping it js free.</description>
