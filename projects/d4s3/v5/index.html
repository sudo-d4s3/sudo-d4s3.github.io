<p>The first version of this site was an overly complex flask app that was essentially a wordpress clone. It was a great learning experience but much more than what I need.</p>
<p>The second version was a trimmed down flask app that allowed me to write pages in markdown on the backend. This was a great solution but required me to host a server.</p>
<p>The third version was probably the best version. I believe it was a hugo site but I lost the infrastructure files and only have the output.</p>
<p>The fourth version was a hugo site that was extremely frustrating to work with. I'm not sure if it was a new version of hugo that changed things or the theme I was using but I found hugo very frustrating to work with. It's possible the third version wasn't hugo.</p>
<p>The fifth version is a flask app that has been crawled to make it statically available on github pages. It's using the source for the second version and wget to crawl it.</p>
