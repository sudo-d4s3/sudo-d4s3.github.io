	<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="zola">Zola</h2>
<p>I have moved everything over to zola. The main issue with the previous version was it was over engineered. Having gone through the conversion of my custom flask app to zola I have a few notes.</p>
<p>The main issue I ran into was that the documentation for Zola is spotty at best. I ended up having to go to forum posts where people wanted to do something similar to me, read github for feature requests or issues, and reading other's templates for specific features. After I got the backbone setup it's pretty easy to write articles. It's as easy as my previous setup which is a huge win.</p>
<p>One specific issue I ran into early on was actually just me not reading the documentation properly. In my previous setup I called partials "sections" and pages "pages" but in Zola a "section" is a collection of partials or "pages". The reverse is more intuitive to me.</p>
<p>Zola's templating system is similar to jinja, which is what I was using, so for the most part I didn't need to read the documentation for it.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about writing my own static-site generator. It's something I've thinking about for a while and the flask app was <em>kinda</em> like that but it wasn't usable for another site it was specific for my site.</p>
