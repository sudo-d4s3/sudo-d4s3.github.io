<p>There's a few different ways we can do user federation. We can go the comercial route with Active Directory, Entra, Red Hat Directory Services. We could go with FreeIPA, which is Red Hat Directory Services but unbranded or Samba since it can emulate a 2008 AD. We could also go simpler with something like OpenLDAP.</p>
<p>I'm going to use FreeIPA since it handles everything I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>user federation and authentication</li>
<li>ACLs</li>
<li>a CA</li>
<li>integration with SSSD</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I typically prefer Debian-based distros but FreeIPA only supports Redhat-based distros. So the Realm controller will have to be Redhat-based. Our other servers and clients can be Debian-based since the <code>freeipa-client</code> package has been ported to the Debian stable repo. If you want to use a distro that doesn't have a <code>freeipa-client</code> package you can either port it yourself or configure sssd and pam to manually join the realm.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>I downloaded <a href="https://almalinux.org/get-almalinux/">AlmaLinux 9.5 minimal</a>. However I'm fairly certain after I installed FreeIPA I was running the base install since things like <code>pipewire</code> got installed. Created a VM and set it to autostart since its going to be running my DNS. After creating and updating it I set a reservation for it in DHCP and reboot the machine.</p>
<p>The <code>ipa-server-install</code> script is really particular about setup. The FreeIPA docs will tell you to edit <code>/etc/hostname</code> but that won't work. What you <em>actually</em> have to do is edit <code>/etc/hosts</code> and add a line similar to <code>&lt;ip&gt;   &lt;fqdn&gt; &lt;dn&gt;</code>. That last entry is super important because if you dont have it the FreeIPA server installer will install most of the way then stop when it tries to start the web server. This will require you reinstalling FreeIPA.</p>
<p>Since my management laptop isn't enrolled in the realm yet I need to make an entry in my hosts file. This is because the webserver will enforce the use of DNS. After that I got an HSTS error which is new. The last time I installed FreeIPA I didn't run into this so I assume this is a new default. Since Firefox erroneously doesn't have a way to bypass HSTS errors I had to use ungoogled-chromium to get to the login page. (Other Chromium-based browsers also have a bypass.)</p>
<p>I created myself an unprivileged user account in the web interface for later use.</p>
<h2 id="secret-store">Secret Store</h2>
<p>I haven't really documented it but I've been reusing passwords. This is bad for obvious reasons and now that I have user federation setup I'm going to setup a password manager and go back through all the server's I've setup so far and reset their password's with something autogenerated.</p>
<p>So far I've made 9 accounts that need their password reset and stored in a manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 local root vm acounts</li>
<li>2 local user vm account</li>
<li>1 local unifi account</li>
<li>1 realm directory manager</li>
<li>1 admin realm account</li>
<li>1 firewall root account</li>
<li>1 local root hypervisor accounts</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't too many which is why we should do this now before we start making more servers and having this number balloon. Remember that every vm is an immediate 2 more accounts that need to be reset and stored. (root,user)</p>
<p>I'm going to use <a href="https://www.passbolt.com/">Passbolt</a>. It's opensource using the AGPL-3.0 license. Passbolt isn't a typical password manager and it isn't going to be the password manager I use for my personal accounts. Passbolt is similar to CyberArk but much less annoying and janky to use. If that doesn't mean anything to you, you can think of Passbolt being a secret share for non-user and shared accounts. You can put ACLs on specific creds or vaults, share them securely, and setup good audit logs.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-the-server">Setting Up The Server</h3>
<p>I'm creating a Debian VM. (Which means I now have 11 accounts I need to reset and store.) Before installing Passbolt I'm going to add it to the Realm by installing <code>freeipa-client</code>. Apparently my reverse lookup isn't getting set dynamically. I added a PTR record and will make a note of this for later.</p>
<p>Now that it's joined I can setup Passbolt. After setting it up I spent the next hour or so converting all the previous passwords I've previously setup. I also enrolled the unifi controller into the realm and setup DNS records for the hypervisors and the firewall. I also setup DHCP to set the Realm Controller as the DNS server.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>I have a working Realm now but I still have some things I need to do before I am going to start setting up servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Network ACLs</li>
<li>Create a Golden Image</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="edit-dns">EDIT: DNS</h1>
<p>I noticed overnight that my phone didn't have dns. It turns out that by default the dns subsystem for FreeIPA restricts recursive lookups to localhost and the subnet the server is running on. So my phone which was on the wifi vlan wasn't allowed to make those look ups. This can be modified in the <code>/etc/named/ipa-options-ext.conf</code> file. As far as I can tell there is no indication this is the case in the GUI nor is there a way to change this in the GUI.</p>
