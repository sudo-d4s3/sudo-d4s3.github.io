        <h1>My Website</h1>

<h2>v5</h2>

<p><br>
The first version of this site was an overly complex flask app that was essentially a wordpress clone. It was a great learning experience but much more than what I need.</p>

<p>The second version was a trimmed down flask app that allowed me to write pages in markdown on the backend. This was a great solution but required me to host a server.</p>

<p>The third version was probably the best version. I believe it was a hugo site but I lost the infrastructure files and only have the output.</p>

<p>The fourth version was a hugo site that was extremely frustrating to work with. I&#39;m not sure if it was a new version of hugo that changed things or the theme I was using but I found hugo very frustrating to work with. It&#39;s possible the third version wasn&#39;t hugo.</p>

<p>This version is a flask app that has been crawled to make it statically avalible on github pages. It&#39;s using the source for the second version and wget to crawl it.</p>
