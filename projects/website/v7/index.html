<p>I've gotten scarily effecient at reverse engineering my website.</p>
<p>This time it was alot smoother since I knew what I needed to do.
I think it's a bit more jank, especially with how I'm doing the write_up section.
<strong>BUT</strong> it works and thats what matters.</p>
<p>I've left out the homelab section because I'm going to <em>once again</em> restart that project.
I'm going to leave out the older pages and just say to look at the git history for those articles.</p>
<p>The reason I'm using Zola instead of building one like I said I was thinking of in v6 is because I want to start working on the homelab articles again so I just needed <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to break up the homelab section into 2 sections. Homelab Backbone, and Homelab Side Quests. (Names are still WIP). Backbone is going to be the articles that I've been working on: the actual infra that I'm running. Side Quests will be smaller, trying out different software, meta posts, and other stuff that is about my lab but not directly "lab stuff". I had a third category but I think I'll just stick it in Side Quests.</p>
