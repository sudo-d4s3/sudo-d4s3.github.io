<p>I first learned about cyberdecks through <em>Shadowrun Returns</em> and thought the concept was pretty cool and found <a href="https://www.abclinuxu.cz/blog/bystroushaak/2016/2/cyberdecs">this</a> post which has been moved. That post sent me to r/cyberdecks and the first deck I saw was D10D3&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cyberdeck v3&rdquo; which made me want to make one myself.</p>
<p>Now what exactly is a cyberdeck? Well Gibson says &ldquo;eh fuck it&rdquo;. (not actually but he did say &ldquo;&hellip; my sense of that a &ldquo;deck&rdquo; looked like was extremely low-resolution. Really BIG pixels of visual imagination.&quot;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on the conception for my cyberdeck for about 2 years.
There is a lot of concept art for cyberdecks out there but none of them really felt like what I wanted.
I finally found one that I really like. I don&rsquo;t remember where I found it but doing a reverse image search will probably send you to where I got it.

<h2 id="the-rail">The Rail</h2>
<p>I collected all the major materials I need yesterday (1/10/21) and got straight to work.</p>
<p>Beforehand I measured everything I could and sketched the three parts

<p>Originally I wanted to be able to slot in and out the keyboard portion of the deck for upgrades later on down the line. I didn&rsquo;t have enough forsight before I cut the case out of acrylic and didn&rsquo;t make enough room for the teensy so it has to go in the rail housing making it infeasible to make it modular. (and I forgot to mirror the text on the back)

<p>I printed a 50mm x 50mm x 10mm block to combine the lazy susan and rail together. I wanted to screw everything together but I couldn&rsquo;t find any screws that fit it. So I committed a cardinal sin and epoxied the rail&rsquo;s cartridge and the plastic block and screwed the lazy susan to the block. I then had the second most terrifying experiance I&rsquo;ve ever had when I took a dremel to the screws. (The first was when I used a welding torch, or better put &ldquo;fire bad&rdquo;)
